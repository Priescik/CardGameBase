### *Work in progress*
## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a solid basic structure for various card game designs, while following most fitting programming patterns to keep it readible and adaptable to more specific projects.

As a jump-start I used following tutorial serie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgsp9pb0Oi0

As said tutorial is designed specifically for single-player asymetrical roguelike deckbuilding game, many changes were made to make it more generalized, and many new functionalities were added with even more to come.

## Used packages:
- Serialized Reference Editor
