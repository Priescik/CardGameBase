### *Work in progress*
## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a solid basic structure for various card game designs, while following most fitting programming patterns to keep it readible and adaptable to more specific projects.

As a jump-start I used following tutorial serie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgsp9pb0Oi0

As said tutorial is designed specifically for single-player asymetrical roguelike deckbuilding game, many changes were made to make it more generalized, and many new functionalities were added with even more to come.

## Used packages:
- [Serialize Reference Editor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/serialize-reference-editor-297559)
- DOTween

## Features:
### Category : Editor
Battlefield placement gizmo - allows quick changes to battlefield layout, using Editor only you can change the number of fields and whether you want horizontal or vertical split between players.

Simplified, easier to use inspectors (via Serialize Reference Editor)
